# tic-tac-toe, but this time in Forth

the most advanced gaming the 70's has to offer

## Dependencies

You will need [gforth](https://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/) installed.

## Usage

Start forth by typeing `gforth`, then include `forth tac toe` by typing `include ticTacForth.f`. Start a game `tic forth tac` with the word `int`. Make your play by putting the row number (zero indexed) on the stack followed by the column number (zero indexed) and then the word `go`. The dice is cast. Only the strong survive.

A game always starts with player **O**.
